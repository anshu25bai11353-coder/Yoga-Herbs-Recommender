# Yoga-Herbs Recommender

**Yoga-Herbs Recommender** is a Python-based intelligent wellness recommendation system that analyzes user health information and provides personalized **yoga practices** (with duration or repetitions) along with **herbal (jadi-buti) recommendations** and clear explanations for their usage. The project demonstrates an AI-inspired approach to preventive healthcare by combining traditional wellness knowledge with modern Python programming.
